This repository is a demo showing a pattern for API first design with Golang and OpenAPI, See the [Pull Requests](https://github.com/grevian/petstore-demo/pulls) for a series of PRs building and iterating a demonstration service with this pattern

The goal of this approach is to provide a strong tie between the API spec and the Golang implementation, which provides strong typing for request payloads and responses, and for which the spec can be used to generate rich client SDKs
